# Water Level Monitoring System

This project demonstrates a water level monitoring system using an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino. The system measures the water level in a container based on input voltage and displays the height on an OLED screen. Future enhancements include integrating a PID controller for automated water level regulation.

## System Overview

The water container setup includes:

- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Positioned at the top of the container, measuring distance using ultrasonic waves.
- **Water Container**: Marked with height indicators in millimeters.
- **Input/Output**:
  - A pipe at the top for filling water.
  - An opening at the bottom for draining water.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino
- Ultrasonic water level sensor (output: 0V to 10V)
- Voltage divider (to scale voltage for Arduino input)
- OLED display
- Power supply
- 3D-printed enclosure

## How It Works

1. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the water surface and outputs a voltage.

2. The voltage is scaled using a voltage divider to match the Arduinoâ€™s input range.

3. The Arduino calculates the water height using the formula derived from measurements.

4. The height and original sensor voltage are displayed on the OLED screen.

## Future Goals

- **PID Controller**: Automate water level regulation by controlling a pump for filling or a valve for draining.
- **Enhanced Display**: Show additional information such as target level and error margin.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Add IoT capabilities for remote water level tracking.
